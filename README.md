# OSS Guidepost

Helping those who want to give back to the OSS community find a place to contribute

## The Goal

OSS Guidepost seeks make it easy for developers to find projects which match
their skill levels and their interest.

## Not the Goal

There is no interest in becoming yet another project repository. This project is
only focused on helping developers find interesting projects and thereby
enabling them to grow at a much faster pace.

## Impetus

The story has been told an uncountable number of times, "I want to give back to
the Open Source community, but I don't know where to begin." I've uttered it
myself, and I've heard it uttered from those around me as well. It finally
occurred to me that we just need to match a developer's skillset and ability to
the right projects. 

Wow, that sounds really dumb now that it's written down. Nonetheless...

## How it works

It's really simple: project maintainers import their projects from GitHub or
other services, and eager developers search for projects they're interested in.

### Project Maintainers

1. Register with OSSguidepost
2. Import your projects
3. Provide a difficulty rating and maybe a little more information on each
   project
4. Publish it to be searched
5. Wait for eager developers to come and help you make your project better.
  * Well, don't just wait. Keep making your project awesome while you wait.

### Hungry Developers

1. Search for projects
2. From the search results, choose one (or more) you are interested in.
3. Get involved!

## Why are you doing this?

Am I in it for the money, fame, drugs, what? None of the above, I guess. If I
can get some freelance work out of this, that'd be great, but to be honest, I
just want to help the community.

When I began developing, I really didn't have mentors or advisors; I just
fumbled along the best I could, studying what I thought was important. That's
fine, but I think I could have gotten further earlier, had I had some direction.
OSS Guidepost will hopefully help other devs avoid some of the struggles I
faced by partnering them with other - possibly more seasoned - developers and
projects where they can learn.

## How can I help?

You can provide good feedback or suggest features which would make the site
better. Import your projects and Tell other developers about it. Here's a crazy
thought, you could fork it, fix some bugs or add a feature, and issue a pull
request.

But if you want to really help, tell me your story, and let me know that OSS
Guidepost made a difference.
